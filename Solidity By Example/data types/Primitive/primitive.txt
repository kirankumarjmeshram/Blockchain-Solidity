**uint stands for unsigned integer, meaning non negative integers
different sizes are available
uint8 ranges from 0 to 2**8-1
uint16 ranges from 0 to 2**16-1
...
uint256 ranges from 0 to 2**256-1
uint is an alias for uint256

** negative numbers are allowed for int types
Like uint, different ranges are available from int8 to int256

int 128 ranges from -2**127 to 2**127-1
int 256 ranges from -2**255 to 2**255-1
int is an alias for int256


In Solidity, the data type byte represent a sequence of bytes. 
    Solidity presents two type of bytes types :

     - fixed-sized byte arrays
     - dynamically-sized byte arrays.
     
     The term bytes in Solidity represents a dynamic array of bytes. 
     Itâ€™s a shorthand for byte[] .
