constant vs immutable variables
- keywords used to define variables that cannot be changed after they are assigned a value

constant -
- Accessing constant variables does not consume any gas during contract execution.
- Constant variables can be of any type, including primitive types and complex types like arrays and structs
- They are evaluated at compile-time and their values are directly substituted wherever they are used in the code

immutable -
- Accessing immutable variables consumes gas during contract execution
- Immutable variables can only be of value types (e.g., primitive types like uint, bool, address, etc.) and cannot be arrays or structs.
- They are assigned a value during contract deployment and cannot be changed afterward
